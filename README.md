# Clinical Trial Enrollment Prediction

SAS® Clinical Trial Enrollment Simulator is a strategic decision-support tool to design better patient enrollment plans and accurately estimate cost. SAS® Clinical Trial Enrollment Simulator is built on SAS® Optimization software and it helps overcome three primary challenges of clinical trial enrollment planning:


•	The patient enrollment process consists of a long sequence of dynamic events.


•	The hierarchical relationship among country startups, site activations, and patient screening and enrollment complicates the process of design and analysis of patient enrollment.


•	Enrollment planning must be driven by country, site, and patient data sets, and the solution must be robust to the data uncertainty and scalable to any number of countries and sites. 

Furthermore, combined use of simulation, machine learning, and optimization creates the option to deploy enrollment simulations in real-time analytical portals. A shallow neural net built on SAS Viya is used to make predictions for the enrollment.
